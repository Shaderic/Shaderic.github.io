I"(<p>Hi!<br />
I’m Cédric Van Huffelen, a technical artist from Belgium.
Game development has been my passion for many years now. I started with creating small games and ended up digging into large codebases to learn how certain systems worked.</p>

<p>During my studies, I learned a bit more about the different sides of game development, from programming to 3d modeling to rigging and skinning. This makes me capable to form a bridge between artists and programmers.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I developed an interest in real-time graphics and technical art.
This seemed the perfect fit for me since it combines code, art, and math together and you can create amazing things with it. This is where most of my free time goes to, creating shaders or learning about the latest techniques about rendering.</p>
