In recent years, several major emergencies have taken place in Belgium. Think of floods, major storms, chemical accidents and the attacks in Brussels. To be able to respond quickly and correctly, a good knowledge of the risks in your environment and the right reflexes is crucial. The National Crisis Center has prepared a fascinating interactive three-part curriculum for primary school students. The package is supplemented with the exciting online game BE-Ready, which prepares the students in a playful way for every emergency situation. 

During the development of this game I was responsible for the following tasks:

<ul class="general-list">
  <li>Program different minigames</li>              
  <li>Maintain an internal framework</li>              
  <li>Design a state-machine to control the flow of the game</li>              
  <li>Write custom shaders to achieve desired art style</li>              
  <li>Program custom UI components</li>              
  <li>Build for Android , IOS and WebGL</li>              
</ul>
