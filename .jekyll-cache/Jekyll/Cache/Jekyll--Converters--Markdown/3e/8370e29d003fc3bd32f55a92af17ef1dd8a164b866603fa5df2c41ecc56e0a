I"<p>Almost every material in the real world is slightly translucent, this means that light enters the material and is scattered around and then exits the surface.
In computer graphics, this is mostly done with ray tracing. This, however, is a very expensive computation to use in real-time so other methods have to be used. I have updated the Unity’s standard shader based on Dice’s implementation which presents a fast and scalable approximation of translucency for a convincing subsurface scattering look.</p>
