For the exercise game [EXR](https://exrgame.com/){:target="_blank"}, I had to create a new water shader that feels  
realistic but also fits the cartoony style of the game.  
My work consisted of adding the features below and improve the general   
 performance of the water shader itself.

The feature list:

- Normal Mapping
- Depth Gradient
- Planar Reflections
- Depth Based Refraction
- Edge Foam
- Sparkles
- Ripples
